Video recordings of lectures are no longer a rarity in 
the conditions of distance learning. 
Videos may be in an inconvenient format for 
students or contain different artifacts due 
to compression, camera quality, and other factors. 
It is useful to have a presentation of the study material, 
which contains only the text from the board 
because such a view of the material is most 
like the compendium. 

The item of this work 
is creating an algorithm for obtaining panorama 
slides without a teacher from video lecture.

To perform the study
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    SIFT method for obtaining image's keypoints;
  \item 
    Homography for getting panorama slides;
  \item 
    Boykov-Kolmogorov Max-flow algorithm for creating mask of
    moving objects;
  \item
    Denoising and binarizing operators;
\end{itemize}
